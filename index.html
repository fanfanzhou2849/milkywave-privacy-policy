  <h1>Milkywave Casting Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    Milkywave Casting (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to safeguarding your personal information 
    and protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and store your data 
    when you visit our website or use our casting-related services. We operate from California, USA, 
    and our services primarily target international actors. When you visit our site, we may automatically 
    collect information such as your IP address, browser type, and usage patterns through cookies or similar 
    technologies. We also gather data that you voluntarily provide, including your name, contact details, 
    resumes, headshots, reels, and, where necessary for casting logistics, passport and visa information.
  </p>
  <p>
    We utilize third-party tools—such as Google Analytics, Mailchimp, Casting Networks, and Lark Suite—to 
    enhance user experience, manage communication, and streamline our casting processes. We use your 
    information for legitimate casting and production purposes, such as evaluating suitability for roles, 
    communicating about auditions, and arranging travel or visas if required. We do not sell your personal 
    information or otherwise share it with commercial advertisers, but we may disclose it to trusted service 
    providers, travel agents, or visa assistance entities strictly to facilitate production needs. All collected 
    data is stored securely and only accessed by authorized personnel who are bound by confidentiality 
    obligations.
  </p>
  <p>
    We retain your information only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy 
    or as required by law, after which we securely delete or anonymize it. You have the right to request 
    access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data, and you may exercise these rights by 
    contacting us at our designated email address. Your continued use of our website constitutes your 
    agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates we may make. We may revise or amend this Privacy 
    Policy from time to time in order to reflect changes in our services, legal requirements, or operational 
    practices. Updated versions will be posted on our website and become effective immediately upon posting.
  </p>

    If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or our handling of personal data,
