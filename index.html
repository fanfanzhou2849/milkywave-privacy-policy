This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and store your data when you visit our website or use our casting-related services. We operate from California, USA, and our services primarily target international actors. When you visit our site, we may automatically collect information such as your IP address, browser type, and usage patterns through cookies or similar technologies. We also gather data that you voluntarily provide, including your name, contact details, resumes, headshots, reels, and, where necessary for casting logistics, passport and visa information. We utilize third-party tools—such as Google Analytics, Mailchimp, Casting Networks, and Lark Suite—to enhance user experience, manage communication, and streamline our casting processes. We use your information for legitimate casting and production purposes, such as evaluating suitability for roles, communicating about auditions, and arranging travel or visas if required. We do not sell your personal information or otherwise share it with commercial advertisers, but we may disclose it to trusted service providers, travel agents, or visa assistance entities strictly to facilitate production needs. All collected data is stored securely and only accessed by authorized personnel who are bound by confidentiality obligations. We retain your information only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or as required by law, after which we securely delete or anonymize it. You have the right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data, and you may exercise these rights by contacting us at our designated email address. Your continued use of our website constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates we may make. We may revise or amend this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect changes in our services, legal requirements, or operational practices.
